Overview of the Chatbot Architecture and Execution on Hugging Face Spaces
This chatbot application leverages Hugging Face Spaces as a platform for hosting and deploying a question-answering model that interacts with PDF and CSV documents. The setup combines several key technologies and libraries to deliver an intuitive, web-based interface that users can access to ask questions directly related to the content of the uploaded documents.

Technologies and Interfaces
Gradio: This open-source library is used to create an interactive user interface that makes the chatbot accessible through a web page. Gradio handles the front-end of the chatbot, enabling user inputs (questions) and displaying the model’s responses.

PyMuPDF: This library is responsible for processing PDF files, enabling efficient text extraction. PyMuPDF parses the document content and converts it to text, which is essential for embedding generation.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): FAISS is a high-performance library for fast nearest-neighbor search on dense vectors. Here, it indexes the embeddings generated from document content, allowing the chatbot to quickly retrieve relevant text sections based on user queries.

Sentence Transformers: Using a pre-trained Sentence Transformers model, the chatbot generates embeddings (dense vector representations) of the extracted text. These embeddings are what FAISS indexes and retrieves based on query similarity, facilitating accurate responses.

Execution Flow
Build Phase:

Hugging Face Spaces builds the application by installing all required dependencies, including Gradio, PyMuPDF, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers. During this step, the environment is configured to ensure compatibility and proper library support for the chatbot’s functionality.
Data Indexing:

When the application starts, it loads the provided PDFs and CSV files. Text is extracted from each document, and embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers. These embeddings are then indexed using FAISS, allowing the chatbot to search and retrieve relevant content efficiently.
This phase can consume considerable memory and processing time, especially for large datasets or numerous documents.
Server Initialization:

After indexing, the Gradio server launches, establishing a user interface for interaction. If share=True is enabled, Hugging Face Spaces generates a public link, allowing users to access the chatbot externally.
Real-Time Q&A:

Once live, the chatbot listens for user queries. When a question is asked, the application uses FAISS to search for the most relevant document sections, based on embedding similarity, and returns responses sourced from the document content.

1_a_.app_local.py 

This app_local.py script establishes a local FastAPI server to build a robust, internal chatbot for answering questions based on specific PDF documents. Here’s a quick breakdown of why each part is used and the benefits of running this locally:

FastAPI: Enables a REST API setup, allowing users or other services to query the chatbot with questions and receive contextually relevant answers. FastAPI is lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for rapid deployment and local testing.
OpenAI Embeddings & FAISS: By using OpenAI’s embeddings with FAISS indexing, the application creates a semantic search layer, which means that each question asked is matched with the most relevant document sections. This optimizes retrieval and ensures accurate, context-based answers.
PyMuPDF & Text Fragmentation: PyMuPDF extracts text from PDFs, and the text is then split into manageable chunks to improve embedding accuracy and reduce memory usage during processing.
Local Execution: Running this setup locally, especially for initial testing, provides faster access to documents without external hosting limits. Local deployment is useful for development and debugging, allowing full control over the environment and resource management before moving to a production or cloud-based setup.
This local architecture allows efficient testing of the document-based Q&A model, enabling a smooth transition to other environments if needed.

1_b_.app.py -> Chatbot Execution

To deploy this app.py chatbot, follow these steps:

Overview of Deployment
The app.py script creates a question-answering (QA) chatbot for interacting with government documents using Gradio as the front-end interface. Users can ask questions about specific government documents, and the chatbot uses FAISS indexing and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to provide answers based on document content. This is the exact chatbot deployed for QA on government documents.

Steps for Deployment
Environment Setup:

Install the necessary Python packages:
bash

pip install fitz langchain openai faiss-cpu numpy gradio

Make sure your OpenAI API key is available in the script. For security, it’s best to load it from an environment variable rather than hard-coding it.
Run the Chatbot Locally:

Execute the script directly to launch a local server:
bash

python app.py

Gradio will start a web interface, and if share=True is set, it will also generate a public link for external access.

Deploy on a Cloud Platform:

Option 1: Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces by uploading the code and specifying requirements (in a requirements.txt).
Option 2: Use a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud with a setup for serving FastAPI/Gradio apps. Adjust configurations to allow external access and ensure FAISS indexing is properly set up in the deployment environment.
Functionality Recap
The chatbot combines the power of:

PyMuPDF (Fitz): For extracting text from PDF documents.
OpenAI’s Embeddings + FAISS: To create an index of document embeddings for fast, similarity-based document retrieval.
GPT-4: To generate detailed answers using the most relevant document sections as context.
This setup allows users to query specific details about government documents, obtaining relevant information quickly and interactively.

Explanation of convert_csv_to_pdf.py
Sanitization with sanitize_text:

The function sanitize_text replaces problematic characters (such as curly quotes) with safe alternatives for Latin-1 encoding. This step ensures compatibility with FPDF, which supports Latin-1.
CSV to PDF Conversion (csv_to_pdf function):

The function reads the CSV file located at 'C:/Users/natal/OneDrive/Escritorio/Canadian Pr/datasets/combined_data_no_dates.csv' using Pandas.
It then creates an FPDF object to set up the PDF format, font, and page breaks.
Column headers and rows are added to the PDF, with each column adjusted to fit within the page width.
Finally, it saves the PDF to the specified path.
